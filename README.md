# Multilingual-Health-Symptom-Checker-Using-NLP-for-Marathi-People
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered multilingual health symptom checker designed specifically for Marathi-speaking users. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand health-related symptoms entered in Marathi and provides meaningful disease insights in an easy-to-understand format.

The application bridges the language gap in healthcare by enabling users to describe symptoms in their native language, which are then processed, translated, and analyzed using machine learning models. Based on the input symptoms, the system predicts possible diseases and displays relevant information while clearly stating that it is not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis.
